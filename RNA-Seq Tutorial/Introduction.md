# Introduction to RNA Sequence Analysis

## About the Process
In this introductory lesson plan, we will be doing an analysis of data found in "Gene expression responses in zebrafish to short-term high-hydrostatic pressure".

The paper can be found [here](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8920842/).

We will be covering the following skills:
* Setting up your local terminal to conduct RNA Sequence Analysis
* Downloading RNA sequencing data from NCBI
* Quality checking sequence data
* Trimming data
* Using Kallisto
* Statistical Analysis in RStudio
* Visual Mapping of Data

We will only be conducting this analysis on one type of tissue covered in Hu paper, but the transcriptomics gods and I highly encourage you to attempt the same analysis with the other tissues in the paper. This could be good for practice and gaining preliminary knowledge on the awesome project we are about to embark upon!

If you are ready to start, lets go to [Part I](https://github.com/jtm077/Pressure-Project/blob/main/RNA-Seq%20Tutorial/Part%20I.md)!
