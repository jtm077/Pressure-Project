# Trim Galore: Trimming Our Sequences
Alright, y'all. I know what you're thinking. _Omg, Tammi, why would we trim our amazing reads?_ Well, the answer to that, silly, is that trimming our reads removes low-quality bases. We are all about that base here (high-five if you get that reference)! Anyways, it's very common that the end of reads have lower accuracy. It's similar to how I can't read at a 12th grade level for more than five minutes, some processes just are not entirely consistent.
> Trim Galore is a bioinformatics tool that automates the process of cleaning up raw sequencing data by performing both quality and adaptor trimming. It essentially removes unnecessary parts of the read before we put it through ruther anaysis.

Now that we have trimming done, we can move on to part V!
